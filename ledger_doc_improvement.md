Improving Developer Onboarding and Clarity in Ledger's Clear Signing & ERC-7730 Documentation

1. Current Developer Experience: Overview & Gaps

Clear Signing

- Strengths: Concept well-explained with real-world rationale (protection against blind signing).
- Gaps:
  - No full working example of an ERC-20 transfer using Clear Signing.
  - Lack of onboarding clarity on how to test and debug Clear Signing flows.
  - No direct information on firmware compatibility.

ERC-7730 Specification

- Strengths: Formal and well-structured EIP.
- Gaps:
  - No walkthrough on how to generate a compliant payload from a dApp.
  - No sample annotated payload with detailed explanation.
  - Missing real-world use case demonstration (e.g., swap, permit).

Device Management Kit

- Gap: Documentation appears fragmented or incomplete. No entry point or end-to-end flow.

2. ✨ Suggestions for Documentation Improvements

Add a "Quick Start" Guide

Create a dedicated page with step-by-step onboarding for:

- Signing a simple ERC-20 transfer (with example JSON)
- Signing a permit (EIP-2612 style)
- Clear Signing for a swap transaction (with metadata display)

```jsonc
{
  "domain": {
    "name": "Uniswap",
    "version": "1.0",
    "chainId": 1,
    "verifyingContract": "0x..."
  },
  "message": {
    "tokenIn": "0x...",
    "tokenOut": "0x...",
    "amount": "123456789"
  }
  // add visual example of how this will appear on device
}
```

Provide a Compatibility Matrix

```md
| Feature                 | Ethereum App >= | Firmware >= |
|------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Clear Signing          | 1.10.0           | 2.1.1        |
| ERC-7730 Support       | TBD              | TBD          |
```

Improve Code Snippets

- Provide real dApp payloads for developers to copy/paste.
- Add `ethers.js` and `web3.js` usage examples.
- Add a test suite example with Hardhat + Mocha:

```ts
const signature = await signer._signTypedData(domain, types, value);
```

Developer UX & Navigation Suggestions

Navigation Restructure

- Add "Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced" path per topic.
- Tag pages by use case (e.g., "dApp Integration", "Testing", "Security")
- Cross-link with Ledger Live test flows (sandbox mode?)

Add Tooling

- Provide a JSON builder playground (live editor)
- Add a "Test this flow on StackBlitz" button next to snippets

Visual Aids

- Use diagrams to explain data flow: dApp → Wallet → Display → Signature
- GIFs or screen captures of a real Ledger device showing Clear Signing UX

4. Deliverables

| Type         | Description                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Markdown Doc | This file: feedback + concrete improvements           |
| GitHub Repo  | Live ERC-7730 examples, dApp signing examples (JS/TS) |
| Optional     | Wireframe / UI mockup for "Quick Start" experience    |

5. Expected Impact

- Faster onboarding: get to first signature in < 1 hour.
- Safer integration: less blind signing by developers.
- Better adoption: clearer tooling and documentation for teams building DeFi, wallets, swaps.

Bonus Suggestion: "Ledger Dev Cookbook"

A practical guide with self-contained, real-world recipes to help developers adopt and master Ledger integrations.

Chapters Overview

1. Clear Signing for Beginners
- How to enable Clear Signing on device
- Visual expectations on Ledger display
- Signing an ERC-20 transaction end-to-end

2. Using ERC-7730 in Real-World dApps
- Building metadata payloads
- Integrating swap flows
- Structuring payloads for UI clarity

3. Permit and EIP-2612 Signing
- Building typed data for `permit()`
- Ledger handling of typed signatures
- Risks and signature verification

4. Hardhat + Ledger Setup
- Using Hardhat with hardware wallets
- Unit testing signed payloads
- Local testnets and Ledger signing

5. UX Best Practices with Ledger
- Designing wallet-friendly UX
- Prompting user before signing
- Error handling and rejection cases

6. Security Pitfalls to Avoid
- Common mistakes in blind signing
- Double-checking display fields
- Preventing malicious dApp interactions

Each chapter includes:
- Code snippet
- JSON payload
- Screenshot/GIF (Ledger display)
- CLI/test instructions

This cookbook would greatly simplify Ledger integration in DeFi and dApp projects.
